=============
PLEASE READ
=============

This is a basic image processing pipeline design implemented on 
systemC.

Here, the input module captures the image frame and transfers it to a
second module without any modification.

The design is provided as a baseline example that can be used to complete
the given homework.

To complete the homework, students will need to add additional module(s)
between the input and output module that realizes the required image 
processing operations.

You will add and modify the control signals to accommodate a processing
module in the image processing pipeline.

Students are welcome to build their own design from scratch.

HOW TO COMPILE:
